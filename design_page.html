			<h1>Design choices</h1>
			<br>
			<p>The Design choices of the Dino Club website
<br>
<br>

HOME PAGE: 
<br>

The most important element of that page is the information we give about our brand and company. The text indicates that it requires a read first, before viewing anything else. The facts on that page form a unity, since they all have the same spacing and all have the same scale. The banner is at the top of the page, as are the buttons of the other pages. At the bottom of the page, there are some social media links. The reason for these places are similarity and recognition, since it is the same as most websites. Therefore, the is a slimmer chance of people getting confused. 
<br>
<br>

ABOUT US:
<br>

There is a slight similarity to the home page. Again, the page has text with a picture referring to the text next to it. The page also has the same banner at the top, and the same social media links at the bottom of the page. 
<br>
<br>

OUR VISION: 
<br>

There is more similarity to the About Us page. There is some text with our vision and a picture next to it that supports the text. The banner and social media links are also the same as the first two pages. 
<br>
<br>

PRODUCTS
<br>

All the products form a unity. There is a similarity between the facts on the Home page and the products advertised on this page. Again, the banner and social media links are on the same spot. 
<br>
<br>

CONTACT US
<br>

The similarity is of course the banner and the social media links. The scale of the opening times and the send-a-message forum is the same. The two spaces form a unity. 
<br>
<br>

The purpose of the website:
<br>

The website hopes to inform people about our brand in an entertaining and fun way. Since the website is a company site, we hope to advertise our products to the customer segment. The website was built to solely advertise the products, not to sell it!
<br>
<br>


The choices for the connection to the purpose:
<br>

The website has the same colour pallet as the brand logo, and is full of fun pictures, videos and facts, so the younger customers will like to visit the website as well.  
<br>
<br>

The intention we had:
<br>

Our intention was to have a website that is formal enough for the parents (paying customers) to take it seriously, but also fun enough for kids to visit and enjoy. Since we are a profit-company, we are stimulating the buy patterns, in the hope that the kids will support the buy and the parents will actually buy the products. 
<br>
<br>

The audience that we want to reach: 
<br>

We want to reach the parents and the kids. That is why the website is designed to attract the two target groups. The kids are the people we make the products for, and the parents are the ones who buy the products. 
<br>
<br>

The feeling for the visitors: 
<br>

The visitors should feel safe, enjoyed and informed. We hope to inform the visitors about our brand and products, and we hope that the website feels safe on the site to leave comments. Of course, we want the visitors to enjoy themselves. 
<br>
<br>

The chosen theme: 
<br>

The theme we choose was the same as many other toy manufactories, which is a light, fun and informing website.
<br>
<br>

Colours:
<br>

The colour pallet of the website is the same as the one from our logo. This is for recognition, so the customers and viewers will feel comfortable and at ease.
<br>
<br>

Fonts & navigation: 
<br>

The navigation is shown through our menu option, which are the button at the top of each page. The font we use for our text is called “lato”, which is a Google font. 
<br>

Nova: 
<br>

The website does not communicate very well what the goal is, I don’t know what you are selling and who your target group is. Also, there are not enough fun aspects for younger children. I do like that there is an easy menu with buttons to go to other pages. And of course, I like the easy access to your social media platforms due to the buttons at the bottom of each page! 
<br>
<br>

Dilara: 
<br>

The website is very clear and looks formal. I am a bit unsure whether or not the children will like the website too. Maybe add more dino-related-content for them.
<br>
<br>

Cordula: 
<br>

The site looks really dope! I like dino’s too. This site is really fun, but try to make it cuter for kids! I would love to see it again in colour. 
<br>
<br>

Iris: 
<br>

This is fun. Original content and idea, but I would like it to be more clear. I don’t really get who your customers are and what you’re selling. 
<br>
<br>
Oscar:
<br>

The site looks very neat. It isn't as detailed as it could be, which makes the concept very vague.I like the layout and the menu, but the content itself could be more child friendly.

<br>
<p>After these interviews we went ahead and changed the contact page, added a location, and changed the footer. The navigation of the site was fined. WE decided not to change the about page since professional sites don't have a "meet the company" either. </p>
